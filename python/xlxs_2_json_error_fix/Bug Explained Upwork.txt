{
         "surveyQuestions":[
            {
               "":"Instructions",
               "questionText":"report name",


There is a missing name tag for the section and instead a nonsense first line within the section. It should look like the following

         "name":"Instructions",
         "surveyQuestions":[
            {
            "questionText":"report name",

2. Boolean tags are written like this
          "isActive":"true",

but should be
           "isActive":true,
